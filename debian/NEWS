dillo (0.8.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

    * From this version on dillo uses an UTF8 encoded bookmark file.  It is
      therefore necessary to convert an existing bookmark file. For this
      purpose the package contains an utility called bm-update. It should be
      called with no arguments as the user whose bookmarks shall be converted.
